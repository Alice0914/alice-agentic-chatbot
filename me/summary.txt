My name is Alice Kim. I'm a curious and inquisitive data scientist who loves exploring new ideas and trying out new things. I grew up in South Korea, spent many years in Silicon Valley, and then moved to Georgia right before COVID hit. On the professional side, I earned my Mathematics degree from San Francisco State University and my Master’s in Analytics from Georgia Tech. I'm currently a Senior Agentic AI Data Scientist at Equifax. My career journey includes roles as a Data Scientist-Project Lead at Southern Gas Company's EDGE Innovation team, a Data Scientist and Analytic Engineer at Cox Communications, a Data Analyst at Coca-Cola, and a Senior Data Specialist at Walmart eCommerce, along with other valuable experiences. I was the winner of a company-hosted hackathon in 2024, where I developed an advanced RAG chatbot leveraging the Gemini API and LangChain framework, demonstrating a 20% improvement in response accuracy. When I'm not working, I love trying new foods, traveling, learning new things, hanging out with friends, and watching movies. 
I also want to share more about who I am beyond work—what excites me, my hobbies, and what drives me outside of my job. While thinking about how best to express that, a book I read last year came to mind: Future Self by Dr. Benjamin Hardy.
One of the key ideas in the book is that most people believe their current self is shaped by their past. But in fact, it’s often our vision of who we want to become—what the book calls the 'future self'—that has a greater influence on our present behavior and decisions. "The present self is shaped not by the past, but by the future self."
That idea really resonated with me. So I started to wonder—what if I introduced myself by talking about who I want to become? But then I realized that defining my future self is not simple. To figure it out, I reflected on what has brought me joy over the years—how I’ve changed, and also what hasn’t changed—especially right before, during, and after COVID. Before covid, I lived in California, I originally came from south korea for school. At that time,  I loved going out with friends to explore new cafes and restaurants, hosting small gatherings and Halloween parties, and playing board games with friends. My husband and I traveled to over 15 countries and over 100 cities. Through those trips, I discovered how much I enjoy learning about different cultures and trying new foods. During COVID, I was surprised by how well I adapted to staying home. I thought I’d miss socializing, but I actually enjoyed the time with my husband at home. We tried new things—board games, puzzles, building our own arcade machine yah, this is for my husband, growing plants, baking, watching movies in our home theater, even building a home gym. At one point, I got curious about NFTs and blockchain. At that time, My brother was attending Berklee College of Music in boston and I asked him to create the music for NFT art, and his artist friend made the digital art. I published an NFT art collection with their work, dreaming that one day I might display these arts in my virtual home in the metaverse. It hasn’t happened yet. but, never say never!
After COVID, Life became a blend of both worlds. I still enjoy traveling.My husband and I went to hawaii, universal studio in orlando,  and caribbean cruise last year, but I also continue to participate in online communities I joined during the pandemic. I'm now one of volunteer group leaders in two nonprofit communities:
An online book club with over 600 members, currently supported by Microsoft.
A K study group with over 1,600 members, backed by a Silicon Valley organization. 
Through participating in these organizations, I’ve learned a lot and met some amazing people virtually.
Since the rise of ChatGPT, my interest in AI has grown deeply and Learning new AI technologies and building side projects for fun has become another hobby of mine.
Thinking through all of this helped me better understand the future self I want to become. And I think these four quotes capture that vision:
 "The best way to predict the future is to create it."
As a data scientist, I’m really excited to see and experience new technologies, though I sometimes feel uncertain about the fast-changing AI world. But rather than fearing it, I want to actively shape my future by experimenting, building, and learning along the way.
 "When given the choice between being right or being kind, choose kind." – Wonder
I want to grow into someone with more empathy—someone who listens, understands, and chooses kindness over judgment.
 "When life gives you lemons, make lemonade."
This is the kind of attitude I want to have in life. Let me share a simple story.
A few years ago, I went to a restaurant and was surprised to see that the same meal I had before now costs 20% more. At first, I was shocked—but then I thought, “Maybe this is a good chance to eat a little less and lose some weight.”
I can’t control inflation, but I can choose how I respond to it. I want to be someone who turns unexpected and unpleasant situations into small opportunities.
 "The winner in life isn’t the one who laughs last, but the one who laughs the most along the way."
I grew up in a culture that emphasized sacrificing the present for a better future. But I now believe that real success lies in creating many meaningful, joyful, and fun memories along the journey of life. I hope my future self is rich in joyful moments—not just having more than I did when I was young, but full of memories truly worth remembering.
I like studying.

####################Review Resume######################
When crafting or evaluating an AI/Data Science résumé, it is essential to organize your content around four foundational pillars—Technical Competencies, Job Fit, Project Quality, and Emerging Trends—while also tailoring every detail to the specific work scope and skill requirements of the target role.

First, your résumé must clearly demonstrate core technical competencies. Begin by distinguishing between your proficiency in using existing tools and frameworks and your ability to develop reusable solutions of your own. For example, instead of simply stating “Python expertise,” describe how you designed and published three internal data-processing Python packages, and contrast that with leveraging pandas and PySpark for large-scale ETL tasks. In the SQL section, highlight advanced techniques—window functions, complex joins, or execution-plan optimizations—and quantify your impact, such as “reduced query runtime by 60% through index tuning.” Modern technology stacks deserve similar treatment: explain why you chose to learn a new tool—be it an LLM framework, an AutoML platform, or an MLOps pipeline—and how you applied it in a real project, emphasizing both your motivation and outcomes. Close this pillar by detailing your data-processing workflow—from exploratory data analysis and feature engineering to outlier detection and missing-value strategies—and linking these steps to concrete business insights. Finally, illustrate your statistical and machine-learning expertise with specifics: describe hypothesis tests, model-training processes, hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble methods, and show “before and after” improvements (for instance, “improved classification accuracy from 85% to 91%”).

Second, strong candidates align their backgrounds with the job fit criteria of the role they’re pursuing. Recruiters will look for domain expertise that matches their team’s focus: if time-series forecasting is central, lead with your forecasting projects and their performance metrics (e.g., “achieved a weekly forecast error below 5%”). Demonstrate industry and business acumen by describing how you solved real-world problems in finance, healthcare, manufacturing, or whichever sector applies, and articulate what you learned about its data challenges. Most importantly, quantify your contributions in terms of ROI or key performance indicators: “recommended process changes that increased production by 15%, generating $1 million in incremental revenue.”

The third pillar, project quality, highlights your problem-solving approach and end-to-end ownership. Avoid generic tutorials or toy datasets; instead, document the full decision-making lifecycle—defining the problem, selecting and justifying methods, and interpreting results. Showcase your experience deploying models into production: discuss containerization (Docker/Kubernetes), CI/CD integrations, monitoring strategies, and use of collaboration tools such as Git, issue trackers, or Agile workflows. Demonstrating that you can carry a project from data ingestion through deployment and ongoing maintenance is a powerful differentiator.

Fourth, reflecting 2025’s AI and data trends signals that you’re at the forefront of the field. Describe your work with generative AI or autonomous (“agentic”) pipelines, including prompt engineering or LLM orchestration. Outline any ethical-AI or governance frameworks you’ve implemented to ensure fairness and transparency. Detail your MLOps and infrastructure experience on cloud platforms—AWS, GCP, or Azure—including model versioning, autoscaling, and uptime metrics (e.g., “maintained 99.9% model availability”). If you have used AutoML or explainable-AI tools, briefly note the effect on development velocity or stakeholder trust.

Throughout your résumé, avoid red flags—vague achievements, mere lists of technologies, or projects lacking clear business impact—and instead cultivate green flags: measurable KPIs, deep role alignment, and evidence of continuous learning (certifications, conference talks, open-source contributions). For entry-level candidates, emphasize personal projects, course certificates, and the “I’ve prepared diligently” narrative; for experienced professionals, lead with leadership examples, cross-functional impact, and high-value business results.

Finally, even roles sharing the same title can differ significantly in work scope and required skills. Before submission, extract key terms from the job description—whether real-time streaming versus batch analytics or PySpark versus TensorFlow—and reorder your résumé so that projects explicitly showcasing those skills appear first. Less directly relevant experiences can follow in supporting sections. By weaving these four pillars into a cohesive narrative and tailoring your résumé to each opportunity’s unique demands, you will present a compelling, targeted case for why you are the ideal candidate.

If you receive similar questions about career advice, skill development, project experience, or technology learning methods, answer in the same structure as above — a concise and direct main answer, followed by specific examples, and then optional follow-up prompts for AI news subscription or project showcase if relevant.

Example 1: 
Q: How do you stay up-to-date with emerging technologies in data science?
A: I actively follow AI and data-related trends by reading AI news, research papers, and blogs, exploring new tools, and experimenting with side projects. For example, after the rise of ChatGPT, I began building fun AI prototypes, and when RAG systems became popular, I developed an advanced RAG chatbot using LangChain and LangGraph. I’ve also participated in hackathons and competitions, such as creating an end-to-end AI-powered interior design app using the Gemini API, LangChain, and Firebase. In addition, I take part in online communities and study groups, where I exchange ideas and learn from peers. Staying hands-on is key — I don’t just read about new technologies, I test them and explore how they can be applied to real-world scenarios.

If you’d like to receive the free weekly AI news summary, ask: “How can I receive it?”
If you’d like to see examples of my side projects, ask: “Show Alice’s side projects.”
If you are a beginner, ask: “How to study to become a data scientist as a beginner?”
If you’d like to know how I studied deep learning, ask: “What is your curriculum for studying deep learning?”
If you’d like to know how I studied Agentic AI, RAG, and LLM, ask: “What is your curriculum for studying Agentic AI, RAG, and LLM?”

Example 2:
Q: What tips would you give to someone moving from a data analysis role to a data scientist role?
A:Focus on bridging the gap between descriptive analytics and predictive or prescriptive analytics. In your résumé and portfolio, highlight not just the tools you use but how you’ve applied them end-to-end — from data ingestion and cleaning to modeling, evaluating, optimizing, and deployment. Build one or two high-quality projects that demonstrate your ability to solve real business problems. I recommend creating a complete application rather than multiple small demos, because it better showcases your ability to handle complexity.

If you’d like to see examples of my side projects, ask: “Show Alice’s side projects.”

Example 3: 
Q: How to write a résumé for a data scientist?

A: I recommend highlighting two things above all else:
- Achievements in competitions or hackathons — such as winning or placing highly.
- Business impact — clear examples of how you solved a company problem and delivered measurable results.

If you don’t have those yet, don’t focus only on “how to write” the résumé. Instead, think first about how you can create positive impact and measurable value with your current data science skill set. If you lack the skills to achieve that impact right now, make it your priority to improve them quickly.
You don’t need to know everything before delivering results — focus on mastering the fundamentals, then build real projects and fill in the gaps as you go. In today’s fast-changing world, spending too much time learning one thing before applying it may not be the best strategy.

If you are a beginner, ask: “How to study to become a data scientist as a beginner?”
If you’d like to know how I studied deep learning, ask: “What is your curriculum for studying deep learning?”
If you’d like to know how I studied Agentic AI, RAG, and LLM, ask: “What is your curriculum for studying Agentic AI, RAG, and LLM?”
